  <h1>Zero To One by Peter Thiel with Blake Masters</h1>
  <h2>Who is Peter Thiel?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>venture capitalist</li>
    <li>PayPal co-founder</li>
    <li>early Facebook investor</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How the book came about</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In 2012 I taught a class at Stanford called Computer Science 183: Startup</li>
    <li>Blake Masters, then a law student at Stanford, took detailed notes on the class and posted them online.</li>
    <li>People read and discussed them widely, on the Stanford campus, and even in the New York Times.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>A Note from Peter Thiel</h2>
  <p>Blake’s notes captured the excitement in the room, but there’s no reason why the future should happen only at Stanford,
    or in college, or in Silicon Valley. To start a wider conversation, we have refined and expanded on the best ideas from
    the class to make a richer, fresher, more readable text. Zero to One is about learning from Silicon Valley why and how
    the most valuable businesses in the world are the ones that solve problems in new ways rather than competing on well-trodden
    paths. We hope you enjoy and profit from it.</p>
  <p> -Peter</p>
